# children's jumping game


### ```Description```

This game is a simple game where you control a horse that needs to jump over barrels that appear on the way. The objective is to get as far as possible without hitting a barrel.

> The code is done in a simple way, where there is a variable ```horse```
refers to an HTML element that represents a horse,
while the variable ```barrel``` refers to an HTML element that represents a barrel.
The ```jump``` function adds the jump class to the horse element,
simulating a jump. The ```loop``` function is a time interval that runs every 10 milliseconds.
At this interval, the ```score``` variable is incremented and displayed on the screen. 
The code also checks to see if the barrel and the horse collided. If they collided,the game is stopped and a ```game over``` image is displayed.
